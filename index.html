                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing 
                projects.
            </p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things 
                about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I 
                was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned 
                but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also 
                helping others learn and stay motivated.
