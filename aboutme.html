                <h1>Hi there! My name is Leonard and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                <p>After several months of learning in the Full Stack Developer Career Path, 
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my 
                    Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing 
                projects.
            </p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things 
                about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I 
                was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned 
                but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also 
                helping others learn and stay motivated.
